# MCP Tool for XAS and RIXS simulation

The project is a mcp tool that runs simple XAS and RIXS calculations for 3d transition metals using the [CTHFAM](https://github.com/khhsu0724/CTFAMultiplet) package. For installation, please refer to these [tutorials](https://forum.ai4.science/t/mcp-development-guidance/25)

## Utility
If there is an executable binary installed, the mcp tool will run the calculation in place.
You can prompt it by typing:
```
Run an XAS calculation for Fe 3+ configuration
```
The LLM should be able to create input file, run the program, plot and provide ground state information.
